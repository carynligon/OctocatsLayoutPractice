### Day 2 Assignment: Octocats

For this assignment, we were given an html file with the full html built out for this page. Our job was to position everything correctly to make it look like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/assets/master/assignments/html-intro-layout/octodex.png).

Overall, I think this assignment went pretty smoothly for it being only my second day. You can view my attempt [here](http://octocats-responsive.surge.sh/).
